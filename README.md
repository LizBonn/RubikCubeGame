# RubikCubeGame


## Build the project

The game will not be built defaultly. To build the game, run `lake build Game`.

`lake build` will build all the files under the `RubikCubeGame` directory.

## Blueprint

In principle you don't need to build the blueprint locally. Modify the blueprint in `blueprint/content.tex`. It will be built by the GitHub action when you push to the `main` branch.
